minesweeper made in sdl. It is unfinished and im working on [something else](https://github.com/mativ123/obel2d) at the moment, but im most likely going to come back to it.

## on the docket:
* dying when you click a mine
* winning when you clear all mines
* recursively open empty tiles
* UI for selecting dimensions
* presets for dimensions
